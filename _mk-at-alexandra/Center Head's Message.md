`“Playful learners, joyful learning!”`

I embarked on my career as a preschool educator since 2008 and have worked with children aged between 18 months to 6 years of age. I graduated from Wheelock College (now Boston University) with a Master of Science in Early Childhood Education and joined MOE Kindergarten as a Centre Head in 2015. I am delighted to receive our inaugural batch of K1 children at MOE Kindergarten @ Alexandra (MK@Alexandra). Children will be having plentiful opportunities to learn through purposeful play and quality interactions with peers and adults, both indoor and outdoor. Together with my team of dedicated teachers and staff, we look forward to forging strong partnerships with families and nurturing children’s love for learning through meaningful and learning experiences. On to a strong start!
