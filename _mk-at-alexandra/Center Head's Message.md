<p><strong>Playful Learners, Joyful Learning: A Strong Start at MK@Alexandra!</strong>
</p>
<p>Dear Families,</p>
<p>Greetings from MOE Kindergarten @ Alexandra (MK@Alexandra)!</p>
<p>In 2023, it was with immense joy that we welcomed our inaugural batch
of K1 children to MK@Alexandra. Seeing them grow and transition smoothly
to primary school has been a proud and fulfilling experience. At MK@Alexandra,
we embrace <strong>purposeful play</strong> and <strong>quality interactions</strong> as
powerful ways for children to explore, discover, and develop essential
skills in a nurturing environment, both indoors and outdoors.</p>
<p>My journey as a preschool educator began in 2008, working with children
aged 18 months to 6 years. With a Master of Science in Early Childhood
Education from Wheelock College (now Boston University), I have had the
privilege of serving as the Centre Head of MOE Kindergarten since 2015.</p>
<p>Thank you for entrusting us with your child’s early learning journey.
Our dedicated team of teachers and staff look forward to partnering you
for your child’s learning and holistic development. Together, let’s give
our children <strong>a strong start towards becoming lifelong learners</strong>.
<br>
</p>
<p>Warmest regards,
<br>Mdm Choy Yuan Chun 蔡宛芩
<br>Centre Head
