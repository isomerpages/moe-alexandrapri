<h4><strong>Swimming</strong></h4>
<p>The Swimming CCA is dedicated to fostering sportsmanship and resilience
in students while teaching them a variety of swimming strokes. Students
will have the chance to showcase their skills by representing the school
in the National School Games (NSG) for Swimming. Training sessions will
take place at an external swimming pool, offering a supportive environment
for both skill development and competition readiness.</p>
