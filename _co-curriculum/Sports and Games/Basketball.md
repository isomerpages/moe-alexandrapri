<h4><strong>Basketball</strong></h4>
<p>ALPS Basketball focuses on honing fundamental skills like dribbling, shooting,
and passing, while also boosting members' agility and endurance. As a dynamic,
team-driven sport, it helps participants improve their physical fitness,
coordination, and discipline. The CCA fosters an environment of teamwork,
communication, and sportsmanship, where members work together, plan strategies,
and support each other both during and outside of games. Beyond the sport
itself, ALPS Basketball offers a space for members to grow not only in
their athletic abilities but also in valuable life lessons that carry beyond
the court.</p>
<p>This year, the Senior Basketball Boys made an impressive achievement by
securing the National Championship title for League 6 in the National School
Games. Their journey to victory began with a strong performance in the
classification round, where they emerged as the top team in their pool.
Throughout the competition, the team showcased exceptional skill, determination,
and teamwork, ultimately leading them to triumph in the national finals.
This remarkable accomplishment stands as a testament to their dedication,
hard work, and passion for the sport.</p>
