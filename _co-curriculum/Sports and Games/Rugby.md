<h4><strong>Rugby</strong></h4>
<p>Rugby CCA aims to inculcate the values of sportsmanship, resilience and
teamwork through the learning of skills such as tackling, passing and goal
kicking. Our training sessions will help students to develop or strengthen
their agility and endurance.</p>
<p>Discipline is the most important element in Rugby CCA, and only members
with good attitude and skills will be chosen to be part of the school team.
The school team members will represent ALPS in Rugby NSG. Rugby NSG senior
team consists of Primary 6 students only while the junior team can be formed
by Primary 4 and Primary 5 students.</p>
