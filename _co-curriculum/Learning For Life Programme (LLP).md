# **Learning For Life Programme (LLP)**

### Overview of LLP

**Cultural Intelligence (CQ) ─ The Code of Life** aims to develop in our ALPS students Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills so that they can be concerned citizens who are rooted to Singapore, have a strong sense of civic responsibility, are informed about Singapore and the world, and take active parts in bettering the lives of others around them. In short, this LLP enables our ALPS students to GROW and GLOW (**G**ood Character, **L**ove for Learning and **O**penness towards **W**orld-Readiness). 

In developing students’ cultural intelligence (CQ), which is defined as the capability of a person to function effectively in an environment that is culturally diverse (Earley & Ang, 2003), we hope that students will be equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and attitudes to enjoy and benefit from cross-cultural experiences.

Using the DNA double helix as a metaphor, the LLP has two complementary strands. The first strand focusses on developing the Singapore Spirit in our students and the second strand targets to raise a lively curiosity in our students about the world and the culture of others. The two strands are joined together at the bases, where the information is encoded. This symbolises the fundamental understanding of self, which will be strengthened through mindfulness practice and will guide students in their cross-cultural interactions.
