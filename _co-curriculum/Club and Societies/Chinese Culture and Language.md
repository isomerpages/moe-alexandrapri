<h4>Chinese Culture and Language</h4>
<p>The Chinese Culture and Language CCA strives to ignite students' interest
in Chinese culture while fostering a deeper appreciation for its enduring
traditions. Through a diverse range of activities, including Chinese Calligraphy,
Ink Painting, Chinese Chess, Paper Cutting, Poetry Appreciation, Clay Art,
and Tea Appreciation, we provide students with hands-on experiences that
enrich their understanding and appreciation of these cultural arts.</p>
