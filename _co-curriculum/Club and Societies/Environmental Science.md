<h4><strong>Environmental Science</strong></h4>
<p>The Environmental Club CCA teaches students to care for the environment,
apply design thinking to address issues, and practice upcycling to reduce
waste. As Eco-Stewards, they learn about environmental concerns, implement
solutions, share insights, and help maintain the ALPS eco-garden.</p>
<p>Through these activities, students gain IT skills by using platforms like
SLS and Google Slides to create and share materials. They enhance their
communication skills by presenting ideas on conservation, with opportunities
for public speaking at assemblies. Members also develop practical skills
through gardening, and repurposed crafting. These experiences prepare them
to be proactive, informed environmental stewards.</p>
