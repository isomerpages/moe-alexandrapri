<h4><strong>International Chess</strong></h4>
<p>Chess Club CCA aims to hone the logical thinking skills of its members
by teaching them how to play the game of chess. Selected Chess Club members
will represent the school in inter-school chess competitions.</p>
<p>Through the game of chess, students develop strategic thinking and mental
fortitude. Members learn essential chess principles, opening strategies,
and endgame techniques through structured lessons and regular practice
sessions. Our experienced instructors guide students in developing critical
thinking, problem-solving abilities, and concentrationâ€”skills that prove
valuable both on and off the board.</p>
<p>Beyond competition, chess cultivates important life skills such as patience,
sportsmanship, and decision-making. Join us in mastering this timeless
game that combines art, science, and sport.</p>
