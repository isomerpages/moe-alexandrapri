<h4><strong>Cheerleading</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>The Cheerleading CCA empowers students to develop resilience, teamwork,
and precision through training in stunts and gymnastics, performed to upbeat,
high-energy music. Our cheerleaders will get the opportunity to proudly
represent the school at both school and public events and also compete
in local and international competitions. Through Cheerleading, students
not only enhance their physical abilities but also grow in leadership and
confidence, embodying the spirit of excellence and collaboration.</p>
