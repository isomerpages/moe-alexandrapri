<h4><strong>English Drama</strong></h4>
<p>The Drama Club CCA aims to nurture students' self-expression through acting
while fostering a deeper understanding of theatre. It provides students
with opportunities to explore various elements of theatre by engaging in
both onstage and backstage roles. Members actively participate in school
productions and represent the school in the annual SYF Celebrations: <em>The Young Playwright Presents</em>.</p>
