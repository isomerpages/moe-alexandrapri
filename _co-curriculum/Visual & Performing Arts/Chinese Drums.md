<h4><strong>Chinese Drums</strong></h4>
<p>The Chinese Drums Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) offers students a vibrant
and dynamic musical experience. Students learn the art of traditional Chinese
drumming, developing a keen sense of rhythm and timing. This ensemble features
an array of drums and percussion instruments in different sizes, each contributing
its unique voice to create powerful, heart-pounding performances. Through
regular practice and collaboration, students not only hone their musical
skills but also cultivate essential teamwork abilities.</p>
