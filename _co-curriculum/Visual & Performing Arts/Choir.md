<h4><strong>Choir</strong></h4>
<p>The Choir CCA offers an inspiring journey into the world of music, focusing
on rhythm, harmony, and a deep appreciation for diverse genres. With opportunities
to explore both classical and popular music, the choir experience builds
confidence and musical skill. Selected members may also represent the choir
at the prestigious SYF Choir Competition, performing on a larger stage.
It's a place for musical growth, teamwork, and unforgettable experiences.</p>
