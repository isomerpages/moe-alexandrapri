Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) 2015

In 2015, selected artworks from 8 students who demonstrated enthusiasm and passion through the process of learning during their PAL Art lessons were submitted for the Singapore Youth Festival. The artworks were compiled as one complete Art piece called, “Love Inspira”.

Our students were able to apply acrylic paint to canvas and wind twine around forms and shapes without assistance from our teachers. This process helped reveal the unique vision for the future of Singapore art to be student-centred.

“Love Inspira” was inspired by the legacy of artists in the past. It served to motivate and inspire young artists to collaborate as a team to create artworks in the present. It also reflected our attempts to creatively build on this legacy to reveal the unique vision for the future of Singapore art. It was selected from 489 artworks, awarded a Certificate of Recognition and exhibited at Raffles City Shopping Mall from 9 July 2015 to 19 July 2015.

**Sony Creative Science Award (SCSA) 2015**

In ALPS, we believe that Science is best understood by providing students with opportunities to make connections between their world and scientific concepts. Hence, toys provide that motivational and experiential links between science concepts and everyday experience.

The ALPS Toy Maker provides the platform for our students to learn science in a fun and enjoyable way. Not only does it promote creativity, it stimulates students’ curiosity and challenged them to innovate beyond their imagination.

The toys were selected for the 2015 Sony Creative Science Award (SCSA). It is an annual competition jointly organised by the Science Centre Singapore and Sony Group of Companies in Singapore Pte Ltd, with the support of the Ministry of Education and the Agency For Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR).

Two of our students were presented the Merit Award in the ScizKid – Primary 1 & 2 Category. For that, ALPS is recognised for producing the most shortlisted toys in the category.
