<p><strong>Art Play</strong>
<br>Art Play is a permanent play area set up within the school compound. Each
term featuring an artist’s art work as a stimulus, students are free to
respond to the work through their free play with manipulatives, thereby
allowing their ideas and imagination to flow in response.</p>
