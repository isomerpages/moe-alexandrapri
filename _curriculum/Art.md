### Programmes / Activities for Art

Art Programmes @ ALPS feature school-wide art programmes held beyond classrooms.  
 
*   **Art@Recess**     
Held twice a year, Art@Recess is part of the vibrant school culture that ALPS aim to create for our students. During these half-an-hour programmes, students can choose to participate in hands-on craft activities where their creativity can be showcased.

*   **Art Play**  
 Art Play is a permanent play area set up within the school compound. Each term featuring an artist’s art work as a stimulus, students are free to respond to the work through their free play with manipulatives, thereby allowing their ideas and imagination to flow in response.

The annual Aesthetics Week aims to enrich students’ learning in visual and performing arts through exposure to cultures around the world. With a different theme for each year, students will enjoy class performances, hands-on booths and music quizzes that would facilitate their immersion in artful cultural festivities.
