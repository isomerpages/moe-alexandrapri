### Programmes / Activities for Art

Art Programmes @ ALPS feature school-wide art programmes held beyond classrooms.  
 
*   **Art@Recess**     
Held twice a year, Art@Recess is part of the vibrant school culture that ALPS aim to create for our students. During these half-an-hour programmes, students can choose to participate in hands-on craft activities where their creativity can be showcased.
