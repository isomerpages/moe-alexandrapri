<h4><strong>English Language Curriculum at ALPS</strong></h4>
<p>At ALPS, our English Language curriculum is designed to develop students
into empathetic communicators, discerning readers, and creative inquirers.&nbsp;
We have been progressively implementing the national <strong>Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR) 2.0</strong> programme
since 2020, starting with Primary 1. This phased approach now covers all
levels from Primary 1 to 6. STELLAR's vision is to cultivate a love for
reading and a strong foundation in the English Language. By employing engaging,
age-appropriate strategies and instructional materials, we aim to develop
students' language proficiency and promote a lifelong positive attitude
towards reading and writing.</p>
<p>In alignment with the 2020 English Language Syllabus, our curriculum focuses
on developing both effective and affective language use among students,
with an emphasis on <strong>Purpose, Audience, Context, and Culture</strong>.
The syllabus emphasises 21st century competencies, fostering values such
as empathy and cultural sensitivity. Our teaching approaches incorporate <strong>metacognition</strong>, <strong>multiliteracies</strong>,
and <strong>inquiry through dialogue</strong>. To enhance critical thinking,
teachers employ questioning techniques based on Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy, encouraging
students to engage deeply with the content and apply their thinking to
real-world contexts.</p>
