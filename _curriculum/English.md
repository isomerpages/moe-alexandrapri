<h4><strong>English Language Curriculum at ALPS</strong></h4>
<p>At ALPS, our English Language curriculum is designed to develop students
into empathetic communicators, discerning readers, and creative inquirers.&nbsp;
We have been progressively implementing the national <strong>Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR) 2.0</strong> programme
since 2020, starting with Primary 1. This phased approach now covers all
levels from Primary 1 to 6. STELLAR's vision is to cultivate a love for
reading and a strong foundation in the English Language. By employing engaging,
age-appropriate strategies and instructional materials, we aim to develop
students' language proficiency and promote a lifelong positive attitude
towards reading and writing.</p>
<p>In alignment with the 2020 English Language Syllabus, our curriculum focuses
on developing both effective and affective language use among students,
with an emphasis on <strong>Purpose, Audience, Context, and Culture</strong>.
The syllabus emphasises 21st century competencies, fostering values such
as empathy and cultural sensitivity. Our teaching approaches incorporate <strong>metacognition</strong>, <strong>multiliteracies</strong>,
and <strong>inquiry through dialogue</strong>. To enhance critical thinking,
teachers employ questioning techniques based on Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy, encouraging
students to engage deeply with the content and apply their thinking to
real-world contexts.</p>

<p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS FOR PRIMARY 1 &amp; 2</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Drama and Theatre Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>Primary 1 and 2 students have the opportunity to learn drama techniques
and enhance their storytelling skills through an engaging programme that
culminates in a student performance, showcasing their creativity and learning.
As part of this experience, students also attend a live drama performance
by professional actors, where they explore plot, storyline, and character
development through live theatre. To extend their learning, students read
books related to the play and write a recount of their experiences, allowing
them to reflect on what they have learned. This enriching experience not
only deepens their appreciation for drama but also supports their learning
in the English Language curriculum.</p>

<p><strong>Literature Is For Everyone (LIFE) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The LIFE Programme, targeted at Primary 1 and 2 students, introduces them
to quality literature to develop language skills and empathy. Through guided
interactions with stories, students learn language models, experience the
world through characters, and appreciate the elements of compelling narratives.
This programme not only enhances language proficiency but also builds metacognitive
skills by encouraging students to reflect on the characters' experiences
and apply these insights to their own lives.</p>
<p>Each year, Primary 1 and 2 students participate in a <strong>five-lesson module</strong> featuring
a selected book. Primary 1 explores <em>Frog and Toad Are Friends</em> by
Arnold Lobel, while Primary 2 focuses on <em>Freckle Juice</em> by Andrew
Clements. Through these lessons, students engage in activities that deepen
their understanding of the story's themes and characters, fostering a love
for reading and thoughtful reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Read with Your Child (RWC) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Read with Your Child (RWC)</strong> Programme is designed to
nurture a love for reading in Primary 1 and 2 students while fostering
meaningful parent-child bonding. Starting from Term 2, students will receive
a folder containing a series of curated books and an activity card. Together
with their parents, students will read the books and complete the accompanying
activities throughout the term. Upon completing the activity card, students
can exchange it for a <strong>Reading Badge</strong>, celebrating their
progress and encouraging continued enthusiasm for reading. This programme
also supports the development of important values such as responsibility
and resilience through shared learning experiences.</p>
