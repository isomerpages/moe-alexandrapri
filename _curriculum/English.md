*   **Articulation of the ALPS Vision**     
Language is needed to shape thoughts, express emotions and even define the world view of individuals. To be a Reflective Learner, language is needed to encode what one is thinking and reflecting on. To be an Empathic Designer, understanding the language is required to understand others. To be an Inspiring Leader, a good grasp of the language is needed to communicate ideas. 
				
	Therefore, the aim of the English Language Department is to develop our students to be Competent Users of the English Language so that they can be Effective and Confident Communicators.

*   **Articulation of the ALPS Mission**      
The department sets its mission to create an engaging curriculum that will stimulate students’ appreciation of the English Language (EL) so that they can acquire necessary language skills to be competent and confident users of the language to support life-long learning. 

	An engaging curriculum means one that will allow students to cherish and value the learning of EL. In order for students to cherish their learning, they will need to enjoy it. And for them to value the learning, they need to find meaning in their learning. With that as the mission, the department developed the ALPS EL Curriculum: LAMP.

*   **Embracing of the ALPS Philosophy**      
The ALPS EL Curriculum is built based on the ALPS Philosophy.
