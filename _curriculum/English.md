<h4><strong>English Language Curriculum at ALPS</strong></h4>
<p>At ALPS, our English Language curriculum is designed to develop students
into empathetic communicators, discerning readers, and creative inquirers.&nbsp;
We have been progressively implementing the national <strong>Strategies for English Language Learning and Reading (STELLAR) 2.0</strong> programme
since 2020, starting with Primary 1. This phased approach now covers all
levels from Primary 1 to 6. STELLAR's vision is to cultivate a love for
reading and a strong foundation in the English Language. By employing engaging,
age-appropriate strategies and instructional materials, we aim to develop
students' language proficiency and promote a lifelong positive attitude
towards reading and writing.</p>
<p>In alignment with the 2020 English Language Syllabus, our curriculum focuses
on developing both effective and affective language use among students,
with an emphasis on <strong>Purpose, Audience, Context, and Culture</strong>.
The syllabus emphasises 21st century competencies, fostering values such
as empathy and cultural sensitivity. Our teaching approaches incorporate <strong>metacognition</strong>, <strong>multiliteracies</strong>,
and <strong>inquiry through dialogue</strong>. To enhance critical thinking,
teachers employ questioning techniques based on Bloom’s Taxonomy, encouraging
students to engage deeply with the content and apply their thinking to
real-world contexts.</p>

<p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS FOR PRIMARY 1 &amp; 2</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Drama and Theatre Experience</strong>
</p>
<p>Primary 1 and 2 students have the opportunity to learn drama techniques
and enhance their storytelling skills through an engaging programme that
culminates in a student performance, showcasing their creativity and learning.
As part of this experience, students also attend a live drama performance
by professional actors, where they explore plot, storyline, and character
development through live theatre. To extend their learning, students read
books related to the play and write a recount of their experiences, allowing
them to reflect on what they have learned. This enriching experience not
only deepens their appreciation for drama but also supports their learning
in the English Language curriculum.</p>

<p><strong>Literature Is For Everyone (LIFE) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The LIFE Programme, targeted at Primary 1 and 2 students, introduces them
to quality literature to develop language skills and empathy. Through guided
interactions with stories, students learn language models, experience the
world through characters, and appreciate the elements of compelling narratives.
This programme not only enhances language proficiency but also builds metacognitive
skills by encouraging students to reflect on the characters' experiences
and apply these insights to their own lives.</p>
<p>Each year, Primary 1 and 2 students participate in a <strong>five-lesson module</strong> featuring
a selected book. Primary 1 explores <em>Frog and Toad Are Friends</em> by
Arnold Lobel, while Primary 2 focuses on <em>Freckle Juice</em> by Andrew
Clements. Through these lessons, students engage in activities that deepen
their understanding of the story's themes and characters, fostering a love
for reading and thoughtful reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Read with Your Child (RWC) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>The <strong>Read with Your Child (RWC)</strong> Programme is designed to
nurture a love for reading in Primary 1 and 2 students while fostering
meaningful parent-child bonding. Starting from Term 2, students will receive
a folder containing a series of curated books and an activity card. Together
with their parents, students will read the books and complete the accompanying
activities throughout the term. Upon completing the activity card, students
can exchange it for a <strong>Reading Badge</strong>, celebrating their
progress and encouraging continued enthusiasm for reading. This programme
also supports the development of important values such as responsibility
and resilience through shared learning experiences.</p>

<p><strong>ALPS Oracy Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>At ALPS, our Oracy Programme is dedicated to enhancing students' speaking
and listening skills, enabling them to articulate their thoughts confidently
and effectively. We employ school-based thinking frames, sentence starters,
and discourse markers to support students in structuring and expressing
their ideas clearly.</p>
<p>To further enrich our Oracy Programme, we integrate various digital platforms
and tools:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moo-O (Primary 1 and 2): An interactive
storytelling application that transforms students into story characters,
promoting reading fluency and speaking skills through engaging activities.
<br>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS)
Speech Evaluation Tool (Primary 3 to 6): A feature within SLS that provides
feedback on students' reading aloud, highlighting areas such as pronunciation,
fluency, and accuracy.
<br>
</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ALPS-Developed Oral Coach (Primary 5 and
6): An AI-powered tool designed by the school to offer immediate feedback
on students' oral responses, helping them improve the depth and quality
of their conversations.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>HIGHLIGHTS FOR PRIMARY 3 to 6</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>ALPS Writing Programme (Primary 3 to 6)</strong>
</p>
<p>At ALPS, our Writing Programme is designed to nurture creative thinking
and effective writing skills among our students through engaging and structured
activities that progressively build their competencies. Students are introduced
to Making Thinking Visible routines such as See-Think-Wonder to encourage
brainstorming and critical thinking. Students are also introduced to the
concept of <strong>Show, Not Tell</strong>, where they learn to convey emotions
and actions vividly through detailed descriptions.</p>
<p>To make storytelling both fun and meaningful, ALPS has developed the <strong>ALPS StoryBuilder</strong>—a
structured system designed to teach storytelling in a progressive manner.
This system, introduced to Primary 5 and 6 students, helps them build confidence
in their narrative writing. Additionally, we have created <strong>Creative Adaptive and Inventive Thinking (CAIT)</strong> and <strong>Communication, Collaboration, and Information (CCI)</strong> activities.
These are integrated with the use of mentor texts, providing structured
yet flexible opportunities for students to experiment with story elements,
refine their writing, and develop their unique voices. By engaging in these
activities, students not only enhance their storytelling skills but also
find joy and purpose in expressing their ideas creatively.</p>

<p><strong>Literacy Support Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>To support students with diverse learning needs, we offer specialised
programmes, such as the Learning Support Programme (LSP) for Primary 1
and 2, and the Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) and School Dyslexic
Remediation (SDR) for Primary 3 and 4. These programmes, conducted by trained
teachers, are designed to provide targeted intervention, ensuring that
all students have a strong foundation in reading and comprehension.</p>

<p><strong>High-Ability Learners Programme for English Language (HAL-EL) at ALPS</strong>
</p>
<p>At ALPS, our High Ability Learners Programme (HALP) for English Language
is designed to cater to students with an aptitude and passion for the language.
The programme aims to extend students’ learning beyond the standard curriculum,
challenging them to think critically, express creatively, and develop a
deeper appreciation for language and literature. Through differentiated
instruction, specialised workshops, and participation in national-level
competitions, we provide a platform for our high-ability learners to excel
and grow into confident communicators and reflective thinkers.</p>
<p><strong>DIfferentiated Learning (Within Curriculum)</strong>
</p>
<p>The Explorations and Inquiry (E&amp;I) activities are developed and curated
by the Ministry of Education’s Gifted Education Branch, with resources
designed to stretch high-ability learners (HALs). At ALPS, we adapt these
activities where relevant and introduce them during English Language curriculum
time for classes with identified HAL students. These activities complement
the STELLAR 2.0 English Language curriculum by deepening students' engagement
with language through inquiry-based learning. Each STELLAR unit incorporates
E&amp;I tasks tailored to its specific focus, challenging students to explore
concepts more thoroughly. For example, one unit may involve investigating
how technological advancements influence language, while another may focus
on the power of persuasive writing or storytelling. By participating in
these varied activities during curriculum time, HAL students refine their
critical thinking, creativity, and analytical skills, enriching their overall
learning experience.</p>

<p><strong>Reading Circles Programme (After-school Enrichment Programme)</strong>
</p>
<p>Reading Circles for Advanced Readers is a programme designed by MOE Gifted
Education Branch (GEB) as an enrichment provision for High-Ability Learners.
The programme aims to provide students an opportunity to engage in critical
thinking and reflection as they read, discuss and respond to the selected
book. Students gain new understanding and perspectives as they construct
meaning with other readers.</p>
<p>Participants engage in thought-provoking literary discussions on carefully
selected texts: <em>Frindle</em> by Andrew Clements for Primary 4, <em>The Mudskipper</em> by
Ovidia Yu for Primary 5, and <em>Number the Stars</em> by Lois Lowry for
Primary 6. At ALPS, we have customised the lessons to incorporate opportunities
for students to connect literature to real-world experiences, including
societal issues and significant world events such as pandemics or conflicts.
This approach fosters deeper comprehension, critical thinking, and analytical
skills.</p>

<p><strong>Wits &amp; Words Debate Competition</strong>
</p>
<p>Tapping on the Ministry of Education’s Gifted Education Branch initiative,
ALPS participates in the Wits &amp; Words Inter-school Debate Championship.
Towards the end of each academic year, identified Primary 5 students with
strong verbal abilities undergo a series of SLS lessons focused on debating
skills. From this group, five students will be selected to represent the
school in Division 2 of the competition. This programme not only enhances
their oral communication and persuasive skills but also builds confidence
in public speaking and critical thinking.</p>
