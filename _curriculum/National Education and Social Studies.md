<p><strong>Social Studies<br></strong>The Social Studies&nbsp;curriculum
spans the primary and secondary levels, and helps students to grow in knowledge,
develop skills and learn values through examining issues that are of concern
to our society and the world in which we live. Through inquiry-based learning
and authentic learning experiences, students attain relevant knowledge
and understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking
skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives. The Curriculum therefore
envisions Social Studies students as informed, concerned and participative
citizens, competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute
responsibly to the society and world they live in.</p>

<p><strong>National Education</strong>
</p>
<p>National Education is an important part of Character &amp; Citizenship
Education. We aim to provide opportunities for our students to explore
and examine their identity as Singaporeans, and arrive at a common set
of ideals and values. We equip students with the knowledge, skills, and
values to understand Singapore’s history and unique geo-political context,
appreciate our journey to nationhood, cultivate the instincts for survival
as a nation, and have confidence in our nation’s future. The <strong>Citizenship Dispositions</strong>&nbsp;shape
the purpose and approach for National Education:</p>

<p>Classroom-based National Education learning experiences take place during
CCE and Social Studies lessons. Beyond the classroom, key student development
events like Cohort Learning Journeys and National Education Commemorative
Days deepen students’ experiences, allowing students to see the connection
between what they learn in the classroom and real life.</p>
<p><strong>NE Commemorative Events&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>The four core NE events that the school commemorates are Total Defence
Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day.
During these events, the school will organise a variety of engaging and
meaningful activities to foster a sense of pride and belonging to our country.</p>
<p><strong>Cohort Learning Journeys</strong>
</p>
<p>Cohort learning journeys support students’ learning in Social Studies
by deepening their understanding of the heritage and culture of Singapore
beyond the classroom. Primary 3 to 6 students will be visiting the respective
sites listed in the table below for museum-based learning as part of their
Social Studies lessons.</p>
