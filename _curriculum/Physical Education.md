<p><strong>ALPS Botanic Gardens Hike</strong>
</p>
<p>The ALPS Botanic Gardens Hike aims to promote camaraderie between our
P1 and P2 students and school staff. As they explore the scenic paths of
the Botanic Gardens, the hike encourages students to develop resilience
and build class spirit through shared challenges and teamwork. Along the
way, they will deepen their appreciation for nature and the artistic sculptures
scattered throughout the gardens, fostering a sense of wonder and connection
to the environment. To celebrate their efforts, students will conclude
the hike with a rewarding picnic alongside their buddies.</p>

<p><strong>Sports Meet</strong>
</p>
<p>The Sports Meet is a highly anticipated event at every level, providing
students with the opportunity to showcase the skills they have developed
during their physical education lessons. It fosters healthy competition
as students participate in a variety of events, ranging from individual
challenges like running races to group events such as obstacle courses
and relay races.</p>
<p>This event not only emphasizes athletic performance but also cultivates
teamwork, perseverance, and sportsmanship. Prizes are awarded to winners
at the end of the meet, but every participant takes away valuable lessons
in resilience and camaraderie. Whether experiencing victory or defeat,
students learn to embrace both with grace, reflecting the true spirit of
sports.</p>
<p>As we conclude the Sports Meet, we are reminded of the powerful message: <em>“Winners win, winners lose, but winners play.”</em>

<p><strong>P5 Resilience Camp</strong>
</p>
<p>The P5 Outdoor Adventure Camp is a highlight of the year, providing our
students with a unique opportunity to engage in experiential learning beyond
the classroom. Aligned with MOE’s Outdoor Education goals, the camp fosters
the development of important life skills such as resilience, independence,
and teamwork.</p>
<p>Through a variety of carefully planned activities like high-element challenges,
nature exploration, and team-building games, students are encouraged to
step out of their comfort zones, overcome challenges, and build stronger
bonds with their peers. The camp also provides an excellent platform for
students to deepen their appreciation for the natural environment, cultivating
a sense of responsibility towards sustainability and conservation.</p>
<p>By the end of the camp, students not only gain memorable experiences but
also grow as confident and adaptable individuals, ready to take on future
challenges with a positive and resilient mindset. This transformative journey
empowers our students to thrive as active contributors to their community.</p>
