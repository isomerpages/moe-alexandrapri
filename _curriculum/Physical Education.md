### Programmes / Activities for PE

*   **ALPS Southern Ridges Hike**  
The ALPS Southern Ridges Hike aims to promote camaraderie between our P1 and P2 students and school staff. The trail commences at the entrance of Hort Park and ends at Henderson Waves. Besides enjoying the beauty of nature, our students will learn more about the plants and animals in Singapore along the trail. They also get to have a picnic with their buddies as a reward after the 3 km nature walk.
