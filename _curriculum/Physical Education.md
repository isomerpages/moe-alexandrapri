### Programmes / Activities for PE

*   **ALPS Southern Ridges Hike**  

The ALPS Southern Ridges Hike aims to promote camaraderie between our P1 and P2 students and school staff. The trail commences at the entrance of Hort Park and ends at Henderson Waves. Besides enjoying the beauty of nature, our students will learn more about the plants and animals in Singapore along the trail. They also get to have a picnic with their buddies as a reward after the 3 km nature walk.

* **Sports Meet**  

Athletic meets are held for every level to give students a chance to display the skills taught in their physical education lessons and compete with different classes in a variety of events. There are two basic kinds of events - individual and group. A running race is an example of an individual event. Group events, where students are divided into teams, include obstacle and relay courses.     

At the end of the Sports Meet, prizes are awarded to the winners. Participating in various games and sports develop a feeling of sporting spirit. In sports, the participating candidate may win or lose. The student learns to accept both victories and defeats with grace. 

We conclude with the saying, “***Winners win, winners lose, but winners play***”.
