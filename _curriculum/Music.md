### Programmes / Activities for Music Programme @ ALPS

*   **Recess Busking**  
Held once a term, recess busking is an informal avenue where students can showcase their musical talent to their peers. Through such platforms, our student performers will be able to harness their instrumental skills and build confidence through performance. Student audience will also pick up performance etiquette tips and music appreciation during busking.
