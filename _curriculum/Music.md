<p><strong>Recess Busking</strong>
</p>
<p>Held once a term, recess busking is an informal avenue where students
can showcase their musical talent to their peers. Through such platforms,
our student performers will be able to harness their instrumental skills
and build confidence through performance. Student audience will also pick
up performance etiquette tips and music appreciation during busking.</p>

<p>Students can play with the outdoor instruments at the MusicKingdom during

collaborative play, or just explore the timbres of the instruments available
