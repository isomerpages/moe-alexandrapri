<h4><strong>Mathematics Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>The ALPS Mathematics curriculum aims to develop our students into reflective
learners and problem solvers through the use of rich authentic mathematical
experiences. Our programmes lay the foundation for the learning of mathematics
for all students and support the development of the 21<sup>st</sup> century
competencies. They also aim to build our students’ confidence, foster their
interest and shape their attitude towards the subject.</p>
<p>Teaching and learning in the classrooms are centered around the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract
(CPA) approach. Our Math teachers provide targeted scaffolding and engaging
learning experiences to help students understand mathematical concepts
and develop essential skills. Opportunities are also created for students
to enhance their metacognition through thoughtful discussions, allowing
them to deepen their understanding and reinforce the mathematical ideas
explored in each topic.</p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p>Our key programmes aim to support and enrich our students’ learning. We
provide various platforms for the students to apply their learning in authentic
situations.</p>
<p><u>P2 Math Shopping Day</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>As one of the department’s signature events, the P2 Math Shopping Day
provides our students an authentic experience to learn and apply their
learning about money. Prior to the shopping day, the Primary 2 students
must complete some tasks to “earn some money” to purchase the items based
on the scenario presented to them. With the fictitious currency, students
get to practise financial literacy and work in groups to make their purchases
within their budget in our mock-up ALPS Department Store.</p>

<p><u>Math and Science Week</u>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>To foster the joy of learning, the Math and Science Week is organised
annually. During the three-day carnival, students are engaged in diverse
learning experiences such as presentations, hands-on activities and games.
The experiences allow them to have opportunities to present their views
and further enrich their knowledge.</p>
