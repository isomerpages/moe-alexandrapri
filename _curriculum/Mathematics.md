# **Mathematics**

### Overview of ALPS Mathematics Curriculum

The Mathematics Department aims to develop our students into reflective learners and problem solvers by offering rich authentic mathematical experiences to develop studentsâ€™ numeracy and critical thinking skills. We adopt the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) approach in the delivery of our daily Math lessons. We develop Fun Maths @ ALPS Programme to engage students in mathematical learning beyond textbook material and the classroom.  
  

*   **Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract (CPA) Teaching Approach**Our Math teachers make use of manipulatives to engage students in grasping mathematical concepts and mastering mathematical skills. Such hands-on learning experiences help our students see abstract mathematical concepts in concrete and pictorial representations, thus developing deeper conceptual understanding.  
      
    

*   **Fun Maths @ ALPS Programme**Inter-disciplinary level activities provide opportunities for our students to make connections between their mathematical learning and the real world, thereby making the learning of Mathematics come alive.  
    
    *   The Outdoor Learning Experience provides our P1 students the opportunity to explore the school compound to see Mathematics around them.  
        
    *   The Math Shopping Day offers our P2 students a chance to apply the concept of money as they make purchases to address the needs presented in the authentic scenarios given. Through this, our students also develop financial literacy and collaborative skills to accomplish the tasks.  
        
    *   Our Baking Lab sees our P3 students putting their skill of reading measurements on the weighing scales and measuring jugs to good use as they prepare a non-bake dessert from scratch in teams.  
        
    *   The 'My Dream Home' project allows our P4 students to activate their creativity and demonstrate their critical thinking skills to design their dream home abode with their construction skills and knowledge of properties of shapes.  
        
    *   Fun Maths activity sheets are designed with interesting and non-conventional mathematical tasks for our students to apply and communicate their mathematical understanding. Self and peer assessments are incorporated to allow our students to reflect upon their learning.  

*   **Teaching of Heuristics and incorporation of non-routine questions in Topical Worksheets**Heuristics are taught systematically and in a structured manner across the levels. By equipping our students with a repertoire of problem-solving strategies, they will be more confident and better equipped to solve mathematical problems. Regular exposure to non-routine questions also serves the same purpose of developing our students into confident problem solvers.
