<h4><strong>ICT Programme at Alexandra Primary School (ALPS)</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong>
</p>
<p>In today's globalised world, Infocommunication Technology (ICT) is integral
to our lives. At ALPS, we empower our students to understand, integrate,
and apply new technologies, ensuring they remain relevant and competitive.</p>
<p><strong>Our Approach</strong>
</p>
<p>We prepare every child to be 'future-ready' for a digital networked environment
by teaching them to use ICT creatively, independently, and responsibly.
Students will acquire the digital literacy skills through level-based ICT
programmes, school-wide assembly programmes and Home-Based Learning (HBL).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br>Digital Tools and digital literacy</strong>
</p>
<p>Our students learn to use:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collaborative tools (e.g. Google's
G-Suite, Student Learning Space)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Creative tools (e.g. garage band
for Music, digital art)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Presentation tools (e.g. Microsoft
Word &amp; PowerPoint)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comprehensive coding training from
Primary 3 to 5 (under Applied Learning Programme for Primary 3-4 as well
as Code for Fun organized by IMDA for Primary 5)</p>
<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Education</strong>
</p>
<p>In line with MOE's Cyber Wellness Education, we focus on our students'
well-being as they navigate cyberspace. Our school curriculum equips students
to:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Harness ICT for positive purposes</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintain a positive online
presence</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be safe and responsible ICT
users</p>
<p>Key Cyber Wellness Messages</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Embrace technology while maintaining
a balanced lifestyle</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be a safe and responsible
user of technology</p>
<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Be responsible for personal
well-being in cyberspace</p>

<p><strong>Cyber Wellness Initiatives at ALPS:</strong>
</p>
<p>Various platforms are provided for students to acquire and apply their
Cyber Wellness skills :</p>
<p>• Assembly talks</p>
<p>• FTGP lessons</p>
<p>• Dedicated time highlighting the Cyberwellness messages such as Safer
Internet Day, Cyber Wellness Week (set hyperlink to SID and CWW page respectively)</p>
<p><strong><u>Safer Internet Day (Can be standalone page or combined with CW)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Safer Internet Day is an annual global initiative which aims to promote
safer and more responsible use of online technology and mobile devices
among children and young people. This special celebration takes place in
February every year. At ALPS, students attend assembly talk where they
learn important and useful practices for responsible sharing online, to
protect themselves as well as those around them. This will be followed
up with discussions with their Form teachers during FTGP time.</p>

<p><strong><u>Cyber Wellness Week @ ALPS (Standalone page)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Cyber Wellness Week @ ALPS aimed to foster Cyber Wellness and encourage
safe and discerning technology use among our students. The week's activities
were tailored to reinforce the Cyber Wellness messages shared through ongoing
CCE lessons, commemoration of Safer Internet Day and Total Defence Day
(Digital Defence) in Term 2. Through these learning experiences, we hope
to nurture positive digital habits of our students as they navigate cyberspace.&nbsp;</p>
