# **ICT Programme in ALPS**

Infocomm Technology (ICT) has become an integral part of our lives in this globalised world that we live in. We have to ensure that our students are empowered with the ability to understand, integrate and utilise new technologies so as to stay relevant and competitive.

At Alexandra Primary School, we prepare every child to be ‘future-ready’ for a digital networked environment by learning to use ICT creatively, independently and responsibly for learning. Students will acquire the digital literacy skills through level-based ICT programmes, school-wide assembly programmes and Home-Based Learning (HBL). Some examples of digital tools taught in school include:

* Collaborative tools such as Google’s G-Suite and the Student Learning Space
* Microsoft office applications such as Word, PowerPoint and Excel
* Code For Fun for Primary 5 students

Technology has transformed our work and social environments, changing the way we live, learn and communicate. To thrive in this dynamic environment, students need to learn how to curate digital content, connect and communicate digitally and create digital multimodal products, while taking into account ethical and social practices. As such, our ICT learning experiences are designed for students to acquire the necessary skills, knowledge, attitudes and values to navigate the current and future digital landscape.
