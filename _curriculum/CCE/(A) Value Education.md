# **A. Value Education**

### Explicit Teaching of HER3OIC values and SEL competencies through Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and CCE lessons (in Mother Tongue Language

The weekly assembly programme is focussed on inculcating the HER3OIC values in students. This year, the values of focus for each term are as follows: 
 
Term 1: Respect & Responsibility     
Term 2: Empathy & Creativity    
Term 3: Harmony & Optimism      
Term 4: Resilience & Integrity 

The FTGP and CCE lessons serve to further reinforce the values discussed at Assembly. They provide a platform for teachers to have quality interactions with students and teach socio-emotional competencies (i.e. self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship management and responsible decision-making). Lessons on Cyber Wellness (CW) and Education and Career Guidance (ECG) are incorporated into the FTGP package.
