<h4><strong>A. Value Education</strong></h4>
<h4>Explicit Teaching of HER3OIC values and SEL competencies through Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) and CCE lessons (in Mother Tongue Language</h4>
<p>The weekly assembly programme is focussed on inculcating the HER<sub>3</sub>OIC
values in students. This year, the values of focus for each term are as
follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Term 1: Respect &amp; Responsibility&nbsp;
<br>Term 2: Empathy &amp; Creativity
<br>Term 3: Harmony &amp; Optimism&nbsp;
<br>Term 4: Resilience &amp; Integrity&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FTGP and CCE lessons serve to further reinforce the values discussed
at Assembly. They provide a platform for teachers to have quality interactions
with students and teach socio-emotional competencies (i.e. self-awareness,
self-management, social awareness, relationship management and responsible
decision-making). Lessons on Cyber Wellness (CW) and Education and Career
Guidance (ECG) are incorporated into the FTGP package.</p>
