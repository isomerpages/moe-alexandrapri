# **G. Citizenship Education**

In line with the goal of strengthening the Singapore Spirit, Citizenship Education in ALPS aims to develop in students an awareness of the facts, opportunities and circumstances facing Singapore as well as a strong sense of emotional belong, pride and respect for the community and nation. 

The ALPS Citizenship Education programme adopts the Head, Heart and Hands approach, with an emphasis on experiential learning and active participation. All NE experiences seek to engage both the heart and mind, and develop citizenship dispositions in the students.  

Citizenship Education is delivered through both formal and informal curricula, which include:  


(i) **Social Studies (SS) curriculum** – The curriculum seeks to cultivate in students an understanding of the basic facts of Singapore society and the interdependence of people of different races and occupations;        

(ii) **Little NE Ambassadors programme** – Students are given opportunities to lead the school in pledge-taking and flag-bearing daily;

(iii) **Commemoration of NE Core Events (i.e. Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day and National Day)** – For each event, students are explicitly taught key NE messages and the significance of various events. They are given opportunities to apply their learning through various engaging hands-on activities; and
