# **(H) Education & Career Guidance**

At ALPS, students develop greater awareness of future education pathways and careers through a variety of experiences. Students are exposed to various careers in various learning journeys. 

At Primary 4, students embark on a learning journey to Kidzania to gain initial hands-on experience into the world of work. 

Since 2018, Primary 5 students take part in an annual ECG Carnival where they gain insights from sharings by speakers of various industries and experience hands-on activities relating to work in various industries. 

Students also learn to appreciate the importance of all occupations during the annual Labour Day commemoration.
