# **Character & Citizenship Education**

Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) has always been at the heart of education in ALPS.  

The CCE programme at ALPS takes reference from the Ministry of Education’s Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes (See Fig. below). It emphasises the learning of core values, social and emotional competencies (middle ring) and 21st century competencies necessary for the globalised world (outer ring). Together, the knowledge, skills and values learnt will enable our young to live meaningfully, capitalise on the rich opportunities of the new digital age, while keeping a strong Singapore heartbeat. The aim of the CCE programme is to develop in every Singaporean child, a confident person, a self-directed learner, a concerned citizen and an active contributor.
