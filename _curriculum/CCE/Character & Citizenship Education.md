# **Character & Citizenship Education**

Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) has always been at the heart of education in ALPS.  

The CCE programme at ALPS takes reference from the Ministry of Education’s Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes (See Fig. below). It emphasises the learning of core values, social and emotional competencies (middle ring) and 21st century competencies necessary for the globalised world (outer ring). Together, the knowledge, skills and values learnt will enable our young to live meaningfully, capitalise on the rich opportunities of the new digital age, while keeping a strong Singapore heartbeat. The aim of the CCE programme is to develop in every Singaporean child, a confident person, a self-directed learner, a concerned citizen and an active contributor.

Overview of ALPS CCE Programmes
-------------------------------

To achieve ALPS’ mission and vision of helping students grow and glow to become reflective learners, empathic designers and inspiring leaders, CCE involves a whole-school approach. 

  

*   ALPS provides a conducive environment for CCE with a strong culture of care built on positive relationships. A positive and caring environment provides a good model of how positive relationships are like and provides a role model for exemplification of values of respect, empathy and harmony. 
*   Students learn socio-emotional competencies and values explicitly through the CCE curriculum (comprising values-themed Assembly programmes, FTGP and CCE lessons) as well as through modules with specific contexts (Education and Career Guidance, Sexuality Education and Cyber Wellness). CCE is also explicitly infused into the teaching and learning of all subject areas.
    
*   There are also various authentic platforms and opportunities for children to learn, apply and embody the ALPS HER3OIC values, knowledge and skills. These platforms are also used to track students’ attainment of the desired values and SEL skills.
