<h4><strong>Character &amp; Citizenship Education</strong></h4>
<p>Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) has always been at the heart
of education in ALPS.</p>
<p>The CCE programme at ALPS takes reference from the Ministry of Education’s
Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes (See Fig.
below). It emphasises the learning of core values, social and emotional
competencies (middle ring) and 21st century competencies necessary for
the globalised world (outer ring). Together, the knowledge, skills and
values learnt will enable our young to live meaningfully, capitalise on
the rich opportunities of the new digital age, while keeping a strong Singapore
heartbeat. The aim of the CCE programme is to develop in every Singaporean
child, a confident person, a self-directed learner, a concerned citizen
and an active contributor.</p>

<h2>Overview of ALPS CCE Programmes</h2>
<p>To achieve ALPS’ mission and vision of helping students grow and glow
to become reflective learners, empathic designers and inspiring leaders,
CCE involves a whole-school approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ALPS provides a conducive environment for CCE with a strong culture of
care built on positive relationships. A positive and caring environment
provides a good model of how positive relationships are like and provides
a role model for exemplification of values of respect, empathy and harmony.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students learn socio-emotional competencies and values explicitly through
the CCE curriculum (comprising values-themed Assembly programmes, FTGP
and CCE lessons) as well as through modules with specific contexts (Education
and Career Guidance, Sexuality Education and Cyber Wellness). CCE is also
explicitly infused into the teaching and learning of all subject areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are also various authentic platforms and opportunities for children
to learn, apply and embody the ALPS HER3OIC values, knowledge and skills.
These platforms are also used to track students’ attainment of the desired
values and SEL skills.</p>
