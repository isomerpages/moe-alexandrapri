# **F. Values-in-Action (VIA)**

VIA at ALPS provides opportunities for students to live out the HER3OIC values and to develop social responsibility through meaningful contributions to the family, school and the community. Through the process, the aim is for students to develop a sense of ownership and confidence in creating a positive impact on others in future. VIA Programmes include the following: 

_(i) Everyday Responsibilities_ 

At ALPS, we emphasise “keeping the place cleaner than before”. All students are involved in daily cleaning of the canteen and their classrooms. At the end of each school day, students tidy up their classrooms on the playing of the “clean-up” song. Semesterly, students also take part in Glowing ALPS and take on a more thorough clean-up of their desks and classrooms. This inculcates in students responsibility and ownership in keeping their areas clean and tidy. Middle primary students are additionally tasked to brainstorm ideas to advocate the cleanliness of a particular area in school.

_(ii) Singapore Kindness Movement Project_ 

Since 2016, ALPS Kindness Ambassadors have progressively promoted kindness with various focus each year. The projects aims to foster a positive culture centred on respect and empathy for others. 

In 2018, the Kindness Board was put up to encourage students to share kind deeds which they have done.
