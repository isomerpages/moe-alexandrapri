<h4><strong>(F) Values-in-Action (VIA)</strong></h4>
<p>VIA at ALPS provides opportunities for students to live out the HER3OIC
values and to develop social responsibility through meaningful contributions
to the family, school and the community. Through the process, the aim is
for students to develop a sense of ownership and confidence in creating
a positive impact on others in future. VIA Programmes include the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>(i) Everyday Responsibilities</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At ALPS, we emphasise “keeping the place cleaner than before”. All students
are involved in daily cleaning of the canteen and their classrooms. At
the end of each school day, students tidy up their classrooms on the playing
of the “clean-up” song. Semesterly, students also take part in Glowing
ALPS and take on a more thorough clean-up of their desks and classrooms.
This inculcates in students responsibility and ownership in keeping their
areas clean and tidy. Middle primary students are additionally tasked to
brainstorm ideas to advocate the cleanliness of a particular area in school.</p>

<p><em>(ii) Singapore Kindness Movement Project</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2016, ALPS Kindness Ambassadors have progressively promoted kindness
with various focus each year. The projects aims to foster a positive culture
centred on respect and empathy for others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2018, the Kindness Board was put up to encourage students to share
kind deeds which they have done.</p>

<p><em>(iii) P5 VIA Project – Intergenerational Learning Programme (organised in collaboration with Family Central)</em>
</p>
<p>In 2019, the Primary 5 students embarked on a project to plan and implement
a session to interact and share a skill with the elderly. The aim was to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>promote intergenerational bonding; and to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>provide a platform for students to apply their leadership skills and the
HER<sub>3</sub>OIC values.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sessions planned in 2019 included fingerprint art, designing a tote bag,
use of washi tape in decoration and terrarium-making.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students had meaningful interactions with the elderly and reported high
levels of satisfaction in leading this project.</p>

<p><em>(iv) Partnerships with MINDS, Superhero Me and Rainbow Centre</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Selected Primary 6 students have volunteered to take part in exchange
programmes to interact with friends from MINDS and Rainbow Centre. Superhero
Me facilitated some of the exchange programmes. These aim to spark bonds
of friendship between the students and to promote an inclusive culture
in the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students applied the HER<sub>3</sub>OIC values in planning activities
during the interaction sessions and preparing tokens of appreciation for
their friends.</p>
