# **(E) Mindfulness Programme**

The Mindfulness Programme is a unique school-based programme in ALPS, which aims to enhance the psychological, mental and emotional well-being of ALPS students. Through lessons on mindfulness during FTGP periods and regular daily practice of mindful breathing, students develop greater self-awareness and mental equanimity, and are thus better equipped to regulate their emotions, manage stress and cultivate positive social relationships. Students also develop better focus and concentration, which allows them to participate more meaningfully in various school activities.
