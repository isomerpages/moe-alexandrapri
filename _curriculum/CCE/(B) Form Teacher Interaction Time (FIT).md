# **(B) Form Teacher Interaction Time (FIT)**


FIT is held weekly on Friday. It provides a platform for teachers to build strong rapport with students through Circle Time dialogue and other group activities, and helps to cultivate a close-knit and supportive class community. Teachers also take this opportunity to celebrate students’ birthdays to make every child feel valued with a birthday gift created by their classmates at the start of each year.  

Primary 1 students also have Talent Tuesdays, which is aimed at giving students a platform to share their hobbies, interests and talents with their classmates. Through the process, students develop confidence in public speaking.
