<h4><strong>(B) Form Teacher Interaction Time (FIT)</strong></h4>
<p>FIT is held weekly on Friday. It provides a platform for teachers to build
strong rapport with students through Circle Time dialogue and other group
activities, and helps to cultivate a close-knit and supportive class community.
Teachers also take this opportunity to celebrate studentsâ€™ birthdays to
make every child feel valued with a birthday gift created by their classmates
at the start of each year.</p>
<p>Primary 1 students also have Talent Tuesdays, which is aimed at giving
students a platform to share their hobbies, interests and talents with
their classmates. Through the process, students develop confidence in public
speaking.</p>
