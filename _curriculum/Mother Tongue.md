<h4>Overview of Mother Tongue Curriculum&nbsp;</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Objective&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>The Mother-Tongue Language Department aims to nurture self-directed and
life-long learners who can&nbsp;communicate effectively in their respective
Mother-Tongue Languages, in written and spoken forms,&nbsp;and carry on
the good practices of their culture and customs. &nbsp; To achieve this,
besides the MOE MTL&nbsp;syllabus and Character and Citizenship Education
curriculum, the MT Language Department&nbsp;develops fun, exciting and
engaging programmes to prepare students in attaining proficiency in the
4&nbsp;language skills, namely Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing,
and achieving a deeper&nbsp;appreciation of our diverse cultures. The MTL
teachers seek to create a caring, safe and stimulating&nbsp;learning environment
for students to think critically, communicate confidently and make connection
of&nbsp;the cultures associated with MT Languages.</p>

<li>
<p>Programmes</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp; Conversational Chinese and Malay Programme</p>
<p>The Conversational Chinese and Malay Programme was introduced to the Primary
3 students in&nbsp;2016. The purpose of this programme is to provide students
with exposure to the Conversational MT&nbsp;languages. Learning another
MT language for conversational purposes will help to nurture interaction&nbsp;among
the&nbsp;ethnic communities and friendships between students, across races
and religions.</p>
<p>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Mother-Tongue Games Day</p>
<p>The MTL Department provides authentic opportunities for students to use
their MT languages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MTL teachers aim to arouse the students’ interest in learning their
MT languages by&nbsp;planning fun and meaningful activities to help them
reinforce the learning of their MT&nbsp;language beyond the&nbsp;classrooms.</p>

<p>(iv)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Culture Appreciation&nbsp;Programme</p>
<p>The CL Department strives to enhance the lower primary students' interest
in Chinese Language and Culture through attendance at cultural performance
at public performing arts venues.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Primary 3 students, the MTL Department accepts invitation from
Hong Wen School to participate in the school’s Chinese Cultural Appreciation
Programme. This programme allows the students to be exposed to the various
Chinese art forms such as Chinese Painting, Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese
Paper-cutting and Chinese Knots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The post-programme activity conducted in class allows the students to
be reflective and better appreciate the MT languages and culture.</p>
<p>(v) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Culture Festival Celebrations</p>
<p>To help students value Singapore’s socio-cultural diversity, and promote
social cohesion and harmony, the MTL Department organises interesting and
meaningful activities to celebrate Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Mid-Autumn
Festival and Deepavali. These activities allow students to have a better
understanding of the other ethnic races’ culture and tradition and better
appreciate the multi-racial and multi-cultural society in Singapore.</p>
