<p><strong>The Primary MTL Curriculum Framework</strong>
</p>
<p>In Alexandra Primary School, the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department
aims to nurture self-directed and lifelong learners who experience the
joy of learning and become confident users of their respective Mother Tongue
Languages. Grounded in the 2024 Primary MTL Curriculum Framework, our approach
is designed to support students in developing language competence, cultural
appreciation and values, and 21st-century competencies (21CC).</p>
<p>To achieve this, beyond the MOE MTL syllabus and Character and Citizenship
Education curriculum, the MTL Department develops engaging and differentiated
programmes that ignite joy in learning and help students attain proficiency
in the four key language skills: Listening, Speaking, Reading, and Writing.
Our curriculum is guided by the <strong>S.T.R.I.V.E.</strong> principles
to ensure that learning is meaningful, progressive, and relevant to students'
needs.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Strengthening development of skills and 21CC</strong>: Students
are provided with opportunities to apply their language skills in authentic
contexts, enhancing their ability to communicate effectively while developing
global and cross-cultural literacy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tailoring content</strong>: Recognizing that students have different
starting points, we adopt differentiated instructional strategies to meet
diverse learning needs and build confidence in language use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Reinforcing learning</strong>: Language structures and vocabulary
are systematically revisited through various platforms and activities,
ensuring sustained mastery and application beyond the classroom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Igniting joy in learning</strong>: Through interactive lessons,
technology-enhanced experiences, and cultural immersion activities, students
develop intrinsic motivation to explore and use their MTL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Valuing students’ voice</strong>: Pedagogical approaches encourage
active participation, allowing students to express themselves meaningfully
and creatively in their Mother-Tongue Languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Empowering students</strong>: Formative assessments provide timely
feedback, fostering student ownership of their learning journey and deepening
their appreciation of their language and heritage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our MTL teachers are committed to creating a caring, safe, and stimulating
learning environment, where students think critically, communicate confidently,
and connect with their cultural roots. Through this holistic approach,
we aspire to cultivate proficient, culturally rooted, and future-ready
MTL learners.</p>
<p><strong><u>Appreciating our Roots and Celebrating Diversity Celebration of Traditional Festivals</u></strong>
</p>
<p>To help students value Singapore’s socio-cultural diversity, and promote
social cohesion and harmony, the MTL Department organises interesting and
meaningful activities to celebrate Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Racial
Harmony Day, Mid-Autumn Festival and Deepavali. These activities allow
students to have a better understanding of the other ethnic races’ culture
and tradition and better appreciate the multi-racial and multi-cultural
society in Singapore.</p>

<p><strong>Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration</strong>
</p>
<p>On 12 September 2024, students from MOE Kindergarten (MK) and Primary
1 to 4 levels, together with their family members, gathered in Alexandra
Primary School to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival. The main objective
of this major event is to provide opportunities for students to understand
the origins and customs of the Mid-Autumn Festival and recognise its cultural
significance to the Chinese community.</p>
<p>The department also wishes to promote the importance of parent-child relationship
and enable students from different ethnic backgrounds to understand the
core values of the Mid-Autumn Festival that revolve around harmony and
unity.</p>
