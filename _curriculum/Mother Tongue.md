# **Mother Tongue**

### Overview of Mother Tongue Curriculum 

*   Objective       
The Mother-Tongue Language Department aims to nurture self-directed and life-long learners who can communicate effectively in their respective Mother-Tongue Languages, in written and spoken forms, and carry on the good practices of their culture and customs.   To achieve this, besides the MOE MTL syllabus and Character and Citizenship Education curriculum, the MT Language Department develops fun, exciting and engaging programmes to prepare students in attaining proficiency in the 4 language skills, namely Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing, and achieving a deeper appreciation of our diverse cultures. The MTL teachers seek to create a caring, safe and stimulating learning environment for students to think critically, communicate confidently and make connection of the cultures associated with MT Languages.



*   Programmes

(i)    Conversational Chinese and Malay Programme  

The Conversational Chinese and Malay Programme was introduced to the Primary 3 students in 2016\. The purpose of this programme is to provide students with exposure to the Conversational MT languages. Learning another MT language for conversational purposes will help to nurture interaction among the ethnic communities and friendships between students, across races and religions.

  
(ii)     Mother-Tongue Games Day  

The MTL Department provides authentic opportunities for students to use their MT languages. 

The MTL teachers aim to arouse the students’ interest in learning their MT languages by planning fun and meaningful activities to help them reinforce the learning of their MT language beyond the classrooms.

(iv)      Culture Appreciation Programme  

The CL Department strives to enhance the lower primary students' interest in Chinese Language and Culture through attendance at cultural performance at public performing arts venues.                     

For the Primary 3 students, the MTL Department accepts invitation from Hong Wen School to participate in the school’s Chinese Cultural Appreciation Programme. This programme allows the students to be exposed to the various Chinese art forms such as Chinese Painting, Chinese Calligraphy, Chinese Paper-cutting and Chinese Knots. 

The post-programme activity conducted in class allows the students to be reflective and better appreciate the MT languages and culture.

  

(v)       Culture Festival Celebrations  

To help students value Singapore’s socio-cultural diversity, and promote social cohesion and harmony, the MTL Department organises interesting and meaningful activities to celebrate Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Mid-Autumn Festival and Deepavali. These activities allow students to have a better understanding of the other ethnic races’ culture and tradition and better appreciate the multi-racial and multi-cultural society in Singapore.
