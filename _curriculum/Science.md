### The Primary Science Curriculum

![](/images/Department/Science/Upload/science%20curriculum%20logo%201.jpg)

**Objectives of the Primary Science Curriculum**

*   build on their interest and stimulate their curiosity about themselves and their environment
*   acquire basic scientific concepts to help them understand themselves and the world around them
*   develop skills, dispositions and attitudes for scientific inquiry
*   apply scientific concepts and skills in making responsible decisions
*   appreciate how science influences people and the environment


**Overview of the Science Curriculum**&nbsp; &nbsp;

The Science department aims to realize the objectives of the Primary Science Curriculum by ensuring that Teaching and Learning involves the learning of Science content and concepts as well as acquiring process skills, scientific inquiry and reasoning.

Throughout the curriculum, students develop analytical and thinking skills through the use of the science journaling, investigative practical&nbsp;activities, learning journeys and the Applied Learning Programme.

Students are supported and developed in the learning of science&nbsp;process skills such as observing, predicting and analyzing through scientific inquiry.

   **3C Teaching and Learning Approach**

Science teachers adopt the 3C approach, namely Capture, Construct and Consolidate as the fundamental strategies in their approach to teaching and learning. 

**Capture** ideas and interest

**Construct** understanding of the scientific concepts

**Consolidate** learning through exit cards, topical reviews and assessments.

**(A) Teaching and Learning Programmes**  
  
A-1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Experiential Learning  

Science learning in ALPS centres on inquiry and discovery. With this core principle, science learning&nbsp;can take the form experiments or out of classroom experiences to peg the interest of the students.

A-2&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Use of ICT in the Learning Science

The use of ICT is promoted through the use of Dataloggers, Nearpod, Padlet and Augmented Reality through iPads or Laptops. For example, P5 students learn about the Respiratory System.

A-4&nbsp; &nbsp; Science Journal  

Objectives of the Science Journal

*   build on their prior knowledge, readings or classroom experiences to relate to their Science investigation
*   develop conceptual knowledge
*   become more aware of their own learning and what they can do to self- direct it


The Science Journal introduces a scientist that each student will learn in each level. For P3, Jane Goodall,&nbsp;an accomplished conservationist is adopted while Archimedes is the scientist of choice in P4 as the first topic is on properties of matter. Teachers prepare specific materials to be included in the journal such as science drawing of leaves or a 3D flower model. Exit cards, notes and mini-activities are also included in the science journal.

A-5&nbsp; &nbsp; Science Enrichment Programme

ALPS offers the GEP E2K enrichment programme to selected students from P4 to P6. Due to the nature of the programme, class size is pegged at a maximum of 25 students. On average, the programme for each level lasted for 12 sessions which provide sufficient time for 2 to 3 E2K activities. Students are exposed to critical thinking and analysis in scientific experimentation through different scenarios to arrive at scientific theories and principles. For P6 students, they carry out experiments to determine the best possible characteristics of a vehicle that they designed.

**(B) Environmental Education**

In Alexandra Primary School, we want to develop learners who think critically and inventively to solve environmental issues while showing care for the environment.

Our ALPS Environmental Education Programme allows our students to:

**1.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Learn** environmental issues to model the way<br>
**2.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Think of ways to save** the environment and overcome challenges <br>
**3.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Do the actions** that will save the environment to be a good role model <br>
**4.**&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Share with others** to encourage and enable others to care and protect the environment 

To do so, we have programmes such as the **(A)** ALPS P1-P2 Green Challenge, **(B)** Commemoration of environmental events like World Water Day and Earth Day, and **(C)** Everyday Responsibilities such as recycling and clean plate routine to provide students opportunities to learn environmental knowledge experientially.

B-1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;ALPS P1-P2 Green Challenge&nbsp;

This annual event is formulated on the principle that an ALPS student can be a:

* Creative Green Planeteer by Reusing
* Inventive Green Planeteer by Repurposing
* Responsible Green Planeteer by Reusing


		 
As part of our Environmental Education, we have planned tasks for students to design and create useful objects by Reusing and Repurposing paper products. Primary 1 students are tasked to repurpose the&nbsp;cores of toilet roll or kitchen roll. Primary 2 students are tasked to repurpose other paper products. In this way, P1 and P2 students are introduced at a young age to the concepts of reusing and repurposing as a starting point of their environmental education.

The students’ submissions are evaluated using the following criteria:

B-2 &nbsp; &nbsp;Commemoration of Environment Events

In order to raise the awareness of our students to environmental issues, the department plans for certain events to be commemorated in ALPS. Not only will participation in the planned activities help&nbsp;to develop a sense of regard for the environment, it helps to highlight their commitment to be responsible global citizens with a stake in conserving the environment.

World Water Day

The event was commemorated with an assembly talk followed by recess activities in the form of board games and posters to highlight the need to be responsible for water usage.

Earth Day

Earth Day is not as well-known as its cousin ‘Earth Hour’. It is a thematic annual event that demonstrates and promotes environmental awareness and calls for the protection of the earth. The activities for this meaningful event is planned based on the theme for the year. In 2016, the theme was 'Trees for the Earth’. In line with the theme, an assembly talk was conducted to promote environmental awareness. P1 and P2 students were asked to make a pledge that they can embed into a pot of soil at home. P3&nbsp;students were given a planting kit to grow at home.

Clean Plate Campaign&nbsp;

An ALPS student is taught that reducing food waste is an important virtue. Each child is taught to be responsible enough to finish any food that they brought along or purchased during recess. They are asked to clean their food scrapes into a pail before returning their cutlery to the right places. We have appointed Food Ambassadors in the upper primary levels to serve as role models and help to monitor food wastage during recess.

In 2016, ALPS participated in the Food for the Heart Clean Plate Campaign for the first time and came in fourth in a field of 35 participating schools. The result speaks well of the value embedded in our students.

**(C)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Design Thinking in Science**  

ALPS Toymaker Programme &nbsp; &nbsp;

The ALPS Toymaker Programme provides an opportunity for students to apply Design Thinking principles in creating their toys, especially prototyping. The event is opened to all ALPS students who are encouraged to submit their creations. These are then shortlisted and judged using a set of criteria based on the Sony Creative Science Award. Winners will have their creation submitted for the Sony Creative Science Award. Certificates are given out to participants.
