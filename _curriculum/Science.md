# **Science**

### ALPS Science and Enviromental Awareness Programme

**Objectives** 

*   Teaching and Learning to incorporate Scientific Inquiry, Knowledge and Reasoning to foster collaborative teamwork in the learning of Science 
*   Nurturing the ALPS student to be a global citizen who is knowledgeable and inspired to take responsibility for the environment.


**What is Science Learning in ALPS?**   

Learning in Science is both the learning of Science content and concepts as well as acquiring process skills, scientific inquiry and reasoning. We strive to cater to the latter to develop analytical and  thinking skills in our students. Through the use of the science journaling, investigative practical activities and learning journeys, students are supported and developed in the learning of science process skills. Skills like observing, predicting and analyzing are key components of science inquiry.

*   **Programmes**

  
**(A) Teaching and Learning Programmes**  
  
A-1      Experiential Learning  

Science learning in ALPS centres on inquiry and discovery. With this core principle, science learning can take the form experiments or out of classroom experiences to peg the interest of the students.

A-2     Science Investigation in Action (SIA)  

The SIA is used as platform for teachers to evaluate the acquisition of process skills. Through the use of rubrics, teachers are able to give specific feedback on the attainment of process skills through a 3- rating structure of ‘Competent’, ‘Developing’ and ‘Novice’. Each child will complete the activity at each station within a stipulated time frame before moving on to the next one. There are 3 stations for the students to complete. Each station is based on a topic in the syllabus and evaluates specific skills.

A-3     Use of ICT in the Learning of Science

A-4    Science Journal  

To allow students to:

*   build on their prior knowledge, readings or classroom experiences to relate to their Science investigation
*   develop conceptual knowledge
*   become more aware of their own learning and what they can do to self- direct it


The Science Journal introduces a scientist that each student will learn in each level. For P3, Jane Goodall, an accomplished conservationist is adopted while Archimedes is the scientist of choice in P4 as the first topic is on properties of matter. Teachers prepare specific materials to be included in the journal such as science drawing of leaves, cross-section of an orange, fish and comparisons of animals using pictures.

**(B) Environmental Education**

B-1     The ALPS Green Challenge 

This annual event is formulated on the principle that an ALPS student can be a:

* Creative Green Planeteer by Reusing
* Inventive Green Planeteer by Repurposing
* Responsible Green Planeteer by Reusing

     style="width:50%">
		 
As part of our Environmental Education, we have planned tasks for students to design and create useful objects by Reusing and Repurposing paper products. Primary 1 students are tasked to repurpose the cores of toilet roll or kitchen roll. Primary 2 students are tasked to repurpose other paper products. In this way, P1 and P2 students are introduced at a young age to the concepts of reusing and repurposing as a starting point of their environmental education.

The students’ submissions are evaluated using the following criteria:

B-2    Commemoration of Environment Events

In order to raise the awareness of our students to environmental issues, the department plans for certain events to be commemorated in ALPS. Not only will participation in the planned activities help to develop a sense of regard for the environment, it helps to highlight their commitment to be responsible global citizens with a stake in conserving the environment.

World Water Day

The event was commemorated with an assembly talk followed by recess activities in the form of board games and posters to highlight the need to be responsible for water usage.

Earth Day

Earth Day is not as well-known as its cousin ‘Earth Hour’. It is a thematic annual event that demonstrates and promotes environmental awareness and calls for the protection of the earth. The activities for this meaningful event is planned based on the theme for the year. In 2016, the theme was 'Trees for the Earth’. In line with the theme, an assembly talk was conducted to promote environmental awareness. P1 and P2 students were asked to make a pledge that they can embed into a pot of soil at home. P3 students were given a planting kit to grow at home.

Clean Plate Campaign 

An ALPS student is taught that reducing food waste is an important virtue. Each child is taught to be responsible enough to finish any food that they brought along or purchased during recess. They are asked to clean their food scrapes into a pail before returning their cutlery to the right places. We have appointed Food Ambassadors in the upper primary levels to serve as role models and help to monitor food wastage during recess.

In 2016, ALPS participated in the Food for the Heart Clean Plate Campaign for the first time and came in fourth in a field of 35 participating schools. The result speaks well of the value embedded in our students.

**(C)    Design Thinking in Science**  

ALPS Toymaker Programme    

The ALPS Toymaker Programme provides an opportunity for students to apply Design Thinking principles in creating their toys, especially prototyping. The event is opened to all ALPS students who are encouraged to submit their creations. These are then shortlisted and judged using a set of criteria based on the Sony Creative Science Award. Winners will have their creation submitted for the Sony Creative Science Award. Certificates are given out to participants.
