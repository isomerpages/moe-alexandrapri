**What is Science Learning in ALPS?**   

Learning in Science is both the learning of Science content and concepts as well as acquiring process skills, scientific inquiry and reasoning. We strive to cater to the latter to develop analytical and  thinking skills in our students. Through the use of the science journaling, investigative practical activities and learning journeys, students are supported and developed in the learning of science process skills. Skills like observing, predicting and analyzing are key components of science inquiry.
