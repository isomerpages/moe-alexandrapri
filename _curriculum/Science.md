# **Science**

### ALPS Science and Enviromental Awareness Programme

**Objectives** 

*   Teaching and Learning to incorporate Scientific Inquiry, Knowledge and Reasoning to foster collaborative teamwork in the learning of Science 
*   Nurturing the ALPS student to be a global citizen who is knowledgeable and inspired to take responsibility for the environment.

  

**What is Science Learning in ALPS?**   

Learning in Science is both the learning of Science content and concepts as well as acquiring process skills, scientific inquiry and reasoning. We strive to cater to the latter to develop analytical and  thinking skills in our students. Through the use of the science journaling, investigative practical activities and learning journeys, students are supported and developed in the learning of science process skills. Skills like observing, predicting and analyzing are key components of science inquiry.

**(A) Teaching and Learning Programmes**  
  
A-1      Experiential Learning  

Science learning in ALPS centres on inquiry and discovery. With this core principle, science learning can take the form experiments or out of classroom experiences to peg the interest of the students.

A-2     Science Investigation in Action (SIA)  

The SIA is used as platform for teachers to evaluate the acquisition of process skills. Through the use of rubrics, teachers are able to give specific feedback on the attainment of process skills through a 3- rating structure of ‘Competent’, ‘Developing’ and ‘Novice’. Each child will complete the activity at each station within a stipulated time frame before moving on to the next one. There are 3 stations for the students to complete. Each station is based on a topic in the syllabus and evaluates specific skills.
