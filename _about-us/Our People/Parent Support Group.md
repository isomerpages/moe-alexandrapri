At ALPS, we believe that ‘Every parent is a valuable partner in nurturing the child to ‘G.L.O.W’ and we see the home-school partnership as an integral part of our work. The Parent Support Group (PSG) provides an opportunity for parents to be involved in and contribute to school-based programmes. Through the pool of expertise afforded through the PSG, we believe that the learning experiences of our students will be enriched. 

The school has a Parent Class Representative (PCR) system which will be introduced to parents during the Meet and Connect session at the start of the school year.

If parents are interested to find out more about the PSG, please contact them at [alpspsg@gmail.com](mailto:alpspsg@gmail.com).
