<p>At ALPS, we believe that ‘Every parent is a valuable partner in nurturing
the child to ‘G.L.O.W’ and we see the home-school partnership as an integral
part of our work. The Parent Support Group (PSG) provides an opportunity
for parents to be involved in and contribute to school-based programmes.
Through the pool of expertise afforded through the PSG, we believe that
the learning experiences of our students will be enriched.</p>
<p>The school has a Parent Class Representative (PCR) system which will be
introduced to parents during the Meet and Connect session at the start
of the school year.</p>
<p>If parents are interested to find out more about the PSG, please contact
