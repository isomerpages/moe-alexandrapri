# **Parent Support Group**

![](/images/PSG%20exco%202021-2-2.jpg)

At ALPS, we believe that ‘Every parent is a valuable partner in nurturing the child to ‘G.L.O.W’ and we see the home-school partnership as an integral part of our work. The Parent Support Group provides an opportunity for parents to be involved in and contribute to school-based programmes. Through the pool of expertise afforded through the Parent Support Group, we believe that the learning experiences of our students will be enriched. 

  

The school has set up the Parent Class Representative system, and this will be introduced to parents at the upcoming ‘Breakfast with School Leaders’.
