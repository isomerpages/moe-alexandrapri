**Beyond 10 – A Journey Of Hope**

Alexandra Primary School (ALPS) celebrated her 10th anniversary in 2023 and launched the **ALPS Heritage Gallery** to commemorate key milestones of the school. It is the same year that we welcome our first cohort of preschoolers to **MK@Alexandra**. We invite you to visit the relevant webpages to get to know our school’s brief history and what our students and staff are engaged in.

We are thankful for the trust and support of our parents whose sons and daughters began their formal education with us. Together, we help build a strong foundation in our students’ **values, literacy and numeracy skills as well as learning dispositions**. The first cohort of P6 students who graduated in 2019 had set a high benchmark in academic excellence and year on year, our students and teachers had done us proud by giving their best to improve the performance at PSLE. But we know learning should and must go beyond preparing for a lifetime of tests. Instead, we aim to reach out to our students in an **age-appropriate** way to get them ready for life’s opportunities and challenges.

Every one of our students enjoys holistic educational experiences that hone their 21<sup>st</sup> Century Compentencies<sup>1</sup>. Anchored on the school's  HER         <sup>3</sup>OIC values <sup>2</sup>, students learn values, social skills and civic literacy. Besides the core teaching subjects and co-curriculum (CCA, values-in-action projects, cultural exchange programme, student leadership programme, etc), we offer signature programmes to augment our students’ learning. All our P1 and P2 students attend **Speech and Drama** lessons to develop confidence in their communication and imaginative expressions. The **Learning for Life (LLP) programme** aims to give our students competencies to develop cultural intelligence and skills to communicate during cross-cultural exchanges. The **Applied Learning Programme (ALP)** on Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) equips our students with design thinking, dexterity in the use of resources and mental agility. Under this programme, our students explore Science concepts and Financial Literacy. P3 and P4 students attend Coding lessons and P5 students are given exposure to applications of Artificial Intelligence. In 2024, a new makerspace is set up to encourage our students to connect and inspire each other to create and innovate. This injects new initiative into the existing Project Work students are involved in.&nbsp;

We recognize that every child has unique strengths and will support them to realise their potential to be **reflective learners, empathic designers and inspiring leaders**. Our alumnus, Arianne Teow (Class of 2022), received the **Lee Kuan Yew All-Round Excellence (LKY-ARE) Award**, a pinnacle award that recognizes students who are not only strong in academic achievements but also in leadership and contribution to the community. She is an inspiring leader and an example of how we are committed to bring out the best in every child. We are optimistic that going forward, more Alexandrians will win accolades as they pursue their passion in learning with resilience and integrity.

As a school, our mission is to “create a caring, safe and stimulating school environment where each child can grow and glow”. Together with our School Advisory Committee, we welcome you to join us in this purposeful journey of impacting our next generation and ensuring our Alexandrians grow and glow!
