# **Principal's Message**


**Shine from Within, Soar on Eagle’s Wings**

2020 celebrates the courage and resilience of men and women striving to overcome the sudden onslaught of the COVID challenge. Against this backdrop of complex and uncertain reality, one thing is sure. Education of our next generation must continue as a priority to safeguard and stabilize our future. I am truly honoured to assume responsibility as the Principal of Alexandra Primary School (ALPS) with effect from 15 Dec 2020.

Appreciation is due to the founding principal, Mrs Lim Bee Lay, who has led her team in building a firm foundation for the school. Together with supportive stakeholders from the School Advisory Committee, Parent Support Group, parents and the community, the young school of seven years has already successfully groomed two cohorts of graduates. Standing on this solid base, the school aspires to gather strength in carrying out our mission to “create a caring, safe and stimulating school environment where each child can grow and glow”.

I believe in harnessing the power of love to help Alexandrians shine and soar. As writer C.S. Lewis said, “Love is not an affectionate feeling, but a steady wish for the loved person’s ultimate goal as far as it can be obtained.” I hope for our Alexandrians to shine from within, living the school’s HER<sub>3</sub>OIC<sub>1</sub>  values through their word and deed. I have faith that our Alexandrians will be empowered to soar on eagle’s wings, learning to see beyond constraints, ride above the storms of life and rise to greater heights.

As a school, ALPS is committed to bringing out the best in every child through providing a holistic education and engaging the support of many willing hearts and helping hands. We look forward to the partnership of our stakeholders to consolidate and multiply our efforts. The lyrics of the school song rightly captured our aspiration: “The sky is our limit, on eagle’s wings we will take flight.” Together, let us help every ALPS student shine from within and soar on eagle’s wings!
