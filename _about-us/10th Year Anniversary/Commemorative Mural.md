To commemorate the remarkable 10-year journey of Alexandra Primary School (ALPS), the school has commissioned, a local artist, Mr Lee Kow Fong, popularly known as Ah Guo (阿果), to create a captivating watercolour mural that encapsulates its essence and vibrancy. The mural is not merely a work of art; it is a visual narrative that celebrates the heart and soul of ALPS.

Against a backdrop of swirling colours, reminiscent of the iconic Rainbow Staircase connecting Level 1 to Level 4, the mural unfolds a tapestry of the school life. It weaves a story of diversity and unity, portraying the wide spectrum of experiences lived by ALPS students.

Amidst a diverse array of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) ranging from Clubs and Societies represented by Cheerleading to the realm of Sports &amp; Games exemplified by Badminton, and Uniformed Groups—Scouts, we witness enthusiastic learners passionately pursuing their interests. The mural also showcases ALPS' distinctive and enriching curriculum which are supported by specially designed environments like MusicKingdom and the Bouldering Wall.

As this mural unfolds, it celebrates not only the school but also the nurturing environment where students from both ALPS and MOE Kindergarten @ Alexandra **Grow and Glow<sup>1<sup>** in the warmth of learning, friendship, and discovery. The mural stands as a tribute to the past, seeks to illuminate the present, and heralds the future of ALPS, embodying a decade of excellence and a promise of more to come.
