10th Anniversary Tree-Planting On 8th August 2023, 10 sealing wax (red) palms were planted at the school front yard to kickstart our 10th anniversary celebration. It takes a village to raise a child and the presence of our different stakeholders for the Tree-Planting event bears much significance as we celebrate the founding of Alexandra Primary School. Led by our School Advisory Committee (SAC) Chairman Mr Benny Lee school leaders and Centre Head of MK@Alexandra, the palms were planted together with our teacher and student representatives from ALPS and MK as well as distinguished partners from our Parent Support Group (PSG), Lam Soon Singapore, Edible Garden City and My Saviourâ€™s Church. This tree-planting event signifies the strong collaboration of our partners and staff to provide a caring, safe and stimulating environment for Alexandrians over the last 10 years. We look forward to a sustained partnership for the future.
