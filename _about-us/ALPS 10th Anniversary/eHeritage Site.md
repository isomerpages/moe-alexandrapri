from the last decade.</p>
<h4>Celebrating a Decade of Excellence</h4>
<p><strong>2023 marks the 10th anniversary of our school, a milestone that invites us to reﬂect </strong>on
a decade of growth, achievements, and cherished memories. Starting in 2014
with just one level of Primary 1 students, we have grown and glowed into
a vibrant school community dedicated to nurturing young minds and fostering
a love for learning.</p>
<h4>A Journey of Growth and Achievement</h4>
<p>Over the past ten years, our school has made remarkable strides in academic
excellence, core curricular activities, and community engagement. Our students
have consistently excelled in national competitions, bringing pride and
honour to the school. Our dedicated teachers and staff have played a pivotal
role in guiding and inspiring our students to reach their full potential.</p>
<h4>Building a Strong Community</h4>
<p>Our school is more than just a place of learning; it is a community where
students, parents, teachers, and staff come together to foster growth and
well-being. We have built lasting relationships and created a nurturing
environment where everyone feels valued and respected. Our various value-in-actions
initiatives, home-school partnership programmes and community partnership
programmes have strengthened our bonds and made a positive impact on society.</p>
<p>To commemorate this special occasion, we embarked on a series of initiatives
that celebrated our school’s journey and aspirations. A commissioned mural,
tree-planting efforts, and a specially composed song were among the highlights
that brought our community together in appreciation of our shared heritage.
The celebrations culminated in a grand finale on 17th November 2023 during
ALPS Achievers' Day, where students, staff, and distinguished guests gathered
to mark this significant milestone.</p>
<h4>Mural to Commemorate Our Journey</h4>
<p>To commemorate this special milestone, we have commissioned a beautiful
mural by a talented local artist Mr Lee Kow Fong, popularly known as Ah
Guo (阿果) that encapsulates the essence and vibrancy of our school. The
mural is not merely a work of art; it is a visual narrative that celebrates
the heart and soul of ALPS.</p>
<p>Against a backdrop of swirling colours, reminiscent of the iconic Rainbow
Staircase connecting Level 1 to Level 4, the mural unfolds a tapestry of
the school life. It weaves a story of diversity and unity, portraying the
wide spectrum of experiences lived by ALPS students.</p>
