<p>The school will build in the children an excellent foundation in literacy
and numeracy. In addition, the programme will go beyond this to equip students
with the necessary skills to be future-ready and to engage the world while
remaining rooted to Singapore.</p>

<p>In the spirit of Design Thinking, which will be a key pedagogy of the
school, the child will be involved in the design of the learning process
in this child-centric curriculum. The focus will be on processes and skills
for the 21st&nbsp;century, in particular communication and teamwork, collaboration,
creative problem-solving, cultural intelligence, critical thinking, and
design thinking. Cultural Intelligence (CQ) and Environmental Education
will be the school-based curriculum. CQ will develop in our students: the
capability, sensitivity and behavioural flexibility to be effective in
cross-cultural interactions. In Environmental Education, students will
learn about the natural world and understand that everyone must assume
responsibility for ensuring the sustainability of the earth's resources
for future generations. We will teach our children to adopt a designer's
mindset in understanding the world and approaching real world problems.
They will learn to be observant, to understand the needs and views of different
groups of people and to be creative as they explore new solutions. Technology
will be a key enabler in this learning process.</p>
<p>In addition, we will leverage on the infrastructure and financial resources
provided by MOE to nurture the aesthetics and physical domains of each
child through the integration of the arts into the various subjects, as
well as through Programme for Active Learning (PAL), PE and CCA.</p>
