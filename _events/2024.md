<h2><strong>P5 ALPS Resilience Camp</strong></h2>
<p><strong>We are delighted to recount the exhilarating journey undertaken by our Primary 5 students at the Ministry of Education (MOE) Outdoor Adventure Camp, hosted at the Changi Coast Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre. Spanning three days and two nights, our young participants enthusiastically embraced challenges, cultivated new friendships, and unearthed the significance of resilience, harmony, and empathy within a dynamic and adventurous setting.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The central aim of the camp was to propel our students beyond their comfort zones, fostering personal growth and development. The meticulously designed program featured diverse activities aimed at building character, promoting teamwork, and instilling a sense of empathy.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Among the highlights were the high elements, which provided an exhilarating experience for the students. Scaling heights and navigating challenging rope bridges, each activity served as a lesson in determination and tenacity, fostering self-confidence.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Kayaking allowed students to explore their surroundings, pushing their physical limits while collaboratively working with their peers. Caving offered a unique opportunity for self-discovery as students navigated artificial tunnels, relying on instincts and supporting each other through tight spots.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Team-building exercises brought the students closer, nurturing unity and camaraderie. The outdoor hike tested endurance and offered an appreciation for nature, promoting environmental awareness and a connection to the outdoors.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Essential life skills, such as packing for activities and maintaining utensils, were also imparted to the students.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>For many participants, this camp marked their initial separation from parents, providing a valuable opportunity for personal growth and independence. The dedicated camp instructors created a supportive environment, ensuring every child felt safe and nurtured throughout the entire experience.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Parents can take pride in the remarkable resilience and newfound skills developed by their children during this MOE Outdoor Adventure Camp. We believe these experiences will not only be cherished memories but will also serve as a solid foundation for future challenges.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>We eagerly anticipate witnessing the ongoing growth and development of these young minds as they integrate the lessons learned at the camp into their daily lives.</strong>
